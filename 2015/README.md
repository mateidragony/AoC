My code for the annual Advent of Code Competition.

> [!NOTE]
> I didn't actually do this in 2015. I'm doing it now in 2025 because I'm bored... ðŸ™ƒ

## Favorite problems

6. [Probably a Fire Hazard](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/6) (I really thought the lights would draw an easter egg...)
7. [Some Assembly Required](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/7)
10. [Elves Look, Elves Say](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/10) (Don't worry! It's polynomial of degree 71...)

## The problems I struggled the most on

## Least favorite problems

4. [The Ideal Stocking Stuffer](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/4) (This was a bit boring. I got lucky racket has an md5 module!)
