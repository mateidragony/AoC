# Advent of Code 2015 🤶

My code for the annual Advent of Code Competition.

> [!NOTE]
> I didn't actually do this in 2015. I'm doing it now in 2025 because I'm bored... 🙃

## Favorite problems

06\. [Probably a Fire Hazard](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/6) (I really thought the lights would draw an easter egg...)\
07\. [Some Assembly Required](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/7)\
10\. [Elves Look, Elves Say](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/10) (Don't worry! It's polynomial of degree 71...)

## The problems I struggled the most on

19\. [Medicine for Rudolph](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/19) (I don't know how, but I think the input is fixed. The general solution is too slow.)\
22\. [Wizard Simulator 20XX](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/22) (This one was just a bit annoying. So many special rules to keep track of and so many opportunities to make quick careless mistakes.)

## Least favorite problems

4\. [The Ideal Stocking Stuffer](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/4) (This was a bit boring. I got lucky racket has an md5 module!)\
15\. [Science for Hungry People](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/15) (I was really hoping there was a cool calc way of doing this instead of just brute force...)
