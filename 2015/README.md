# Advent of Code 2015 ðŸ¤¶

My code for the annual Advent of Code Competition.

> [!NOTE]
> I didn't actually do this in 2015. I'm doing it now in 2025 because I'm bored... ðŸ™ƒ

## Favorite problems

06\. [Probably a Fire Hazard](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/6) (I really thought the lights would draw an easter egg...)\
07\. [Some Assembly Required](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/7)\
10\. [Elves Look, Elves Say](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/10) (Don't worry! It's polynomial of degree 71...)

## The problems I struggled the most on

19\. [Medicine for Rudolph](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/19) (I don't know how, but I think the input is fixed. The general solution is too slow.)\
22\. [Wizard Simulator 20XX](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/22) (This one was just a bit annoying. So many special rules to keep track of and so many opportunities to make quick careless mistakes.)

## Least favorite problems

4\. [The Ideal Stocking Stuffer](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/4) (This was a bit boring. I got lucky racket has an md5 module!)\
15\. [Science for Hungry People](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/15) (I was really hoping there was a cool calc way of doing this instead of just brute force...)

## Final Notes

Doing this year after having done 2023 and 2024 really shows me how far AoC has gotten.
Some of these questions were a tad scuffed and some were just a bit boring. A lot of the second
problems didn't really expand on the first problem and were often just as easy as the first
problem. You can also tell that they were really trying to go off with a bang with this first AoC
since they included so many common computing problems (traveling salesman, conway's, collatz, 
etc.). Not really the biggest fan of fixed inputs or NP problems, but it's not that big of a deal.
I had a fun time doing this, and I don't see why I shouldn't just keeping going through and play 
the next years I haven't done yet. See you in 2016! (Says me in 2025...)
